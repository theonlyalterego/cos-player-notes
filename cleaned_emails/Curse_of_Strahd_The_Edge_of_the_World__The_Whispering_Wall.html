<p><i>The air at the foot of Yester Hill is different. The scent of pine and ozone from the ritual has been replaced by a cloying, silver dampness that tastes of old copper and ancient dust. Ahead of you, the world simply... ends.</i></p><h3></h3><p>A shadowed wall of <b>impenetrable fog</b> looms above the earth here, stretching forth to meet the heavens far above. It is not a mist that moves with the wind; it is a solid, silent presence. As you stand before it, strange shapes and silhouettes drift through its depths—ghosts of things that never were—and distant voices whisper just out of earshot, calling your names in a language you almost understand.</p><h3></h3><p>Standing thirty feet away from his nightmare, Beucephalus, <b>Strahd von Zarovich</b> rises from a kneeling position as you approach. He pockets something small and luminescent within his cloak, a thin smile playing on his lips.</p><p><i>"Congratulations,"</i> he says, his voice cutting through the damp silence. <i>"You played my little game with surprising competence. I trust Ludmilla's humiliation will serve as a lasting lesson for her."</i></p><p>He gestures to the towering bank of fog behind him.</p><p><i>"The ancestors of the Forest Folk believed this to be the corpse of an ancient god, whose last exhalation of divinity produced this mist. They called it the Whispering Wall. It is said that for those with the courage to enter as pilgrims, the Wall offers a vision of one's <b>deepest desires</b>."</i></p><p>He pauses, his eyes reflecting the silver gray of the mist.</p><p><i>"It is a powerful thing, to know oneself and one's desires. And yet dangerous, as well. I have walked its depths myself. I have seen the white fortress of my youth, the bells of my home ringing through the fog. It is... enticing."</i></p><h3></h3><p>Strahd offers you a final challenge before he grants you the rewards of your victory:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><b>The Pilgrimage:</b> You must step into the Wall and face what you truly want. Strahd promises not to look; your desires are yours alone.</p></li><li><p><b>The Risk:</b> Many become lost, too entranced by the illusions to ever leave.</p></li><li><p><b>The Choice:</b> To return, you must leave under your own power. <b>The way back comes but once.</b></p></li><li><p><b>The Reward:</b> Those who return safely will receive a "shard of the power of the Wall itself."</p></li></ol><p>He watches you now, a taunting glint in his eye, waiting to see if you have the strength of will to face yourselves, or if you are merely "lesser men" doomed to trade your lives for dreams.</p><p>A simple question for each of you... <b>Do you step into the mist?</b></p>Remember his warning: <b>The way back comes but once.</b></div>

<p>“Let’s see. a Towering White wall of mist; White wall of mist blasting up into the heavens and beyond; held within is the risk of becoming Lost, stuck for generations in search of knowledge and power and Dreaming of escape?  And for that small inconvenience, I get to keep… an evaporating shard of mist,” </p>

<p>Gregor’s grin is all teeth and bad judgment; as he he exhales sharply and tugs at his beard..</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“Werewolves’ll no doubt be within too if there’s an impenetrable castle. Next you’ll probably be promising me the opportunity to sit down for a tea party with the Fair Folk, along with lions, tigers, dragons and bloody scarecrows.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The toothy grin flashes wider still, “I do like tea. You shouldn’t threaten me such a good time /and/ a meal! Of course I’m in!!”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“Besides, I can hardly turn down an invitation, nor not be Accepted after a speech like that. You just said yourself there’s probably no way to be out.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The old man glances Skyward, begins to relieve himself of his clothes, before suddenly  stopping with a glance  at the others</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>An awkward cough later, Gregor plucks a loose thread his cloak, tossing the white thread aside into the grass and straightens his belt, mutters more to himself than the others, “err, right. Leaving most of the clothes on.. I suppose..” </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p dir="auto">He glances about the party a final time, and  immediately Harrumphs at them, “Just you wait and watch my greatest desire turn out to be purifying some witch at the stake when it’s all said and done. Ahh well, Best head to it then ; I doubt I could weave in any more shite this evening if I tried!.”</p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size:inherit"><br/></span></p><p dir="auto"><span style="font-size:inherit">Gregor takes up his cane to prepare to enter the mists, harrumphing obnoxiously at the others all the while.</span><br/></p>

He does not offer a hand to help them. Instead, he looks at them with the cold, clinical interest of a scientist watching insects in a jar.</div><div dir="ltr"></div><div>
<p>Strahd produces a small, luminescent spark from his cloak—a <i>glede</i>, pulsing with an inner heat. As he holds it toward the Wall, the fog seems to curl in on itself extending tendrils of wisping misting laced with lightning.<span class="sewun8zzv3ecem9"></span><span class="sewpcae9vpco2ky"></span></p><p>With the sound of cracking ice, the vapor hardens. Strahd opens his palm to reveal four small gemstones, no larger than a fingernail.</p><ul><li><p><b>For Rachel:</b> A <b>Silver Gemstone</b>. It feels oddly warm, smelling faintly of cinnamon and old wood. (Grants the ability to cast <i>Misty Step</i> once by crushing it).</p></li><li><p><b>For Gregor:</b> A <b>Gray Gemstone</b>. It pulses with a frantic, violet light, as if trying to recall the infinite library it was stolen from. (Grants the ability to cast <i>Locate Object</i> once by crushing it).</p></li><li><p><b>For Artur, Molock, and Francis:</b> Three stones <b>one silver, two gray</b> remain in his palm. Though you did not enter, Strahd offers them with a mocking tilt of his head. "A pity to leave a wager unfinished. Take them. Consider them a dowry for the 'peace' you hope to find."</p></li></ul>Strahd mounts Beucephalus, the Nightmare’s hooves igniting with a sickly flame. He reaches into his heavy cloak and produces two final items, with a wave of his hand hovering gently in the air in front of him.</div><div><br/></div><div>Strahd points to the hovering item: </div><div style="margin-left:40px">
“<i>It is said that the god who died here, though its name is lost to time, left several relics behind. This is one of them. I give to you without let or lien The Twilight Crest.</i>"

I expect your attendance at dusk on the night of the moon's last light, in 5 days' time

 My carriage will be waiting at the crossroads of Ravenloft, beyond the western gate."</i></p><p>With a flare of his cloak and a crack of dry thunder, the Count and his steed vanish.</p>
