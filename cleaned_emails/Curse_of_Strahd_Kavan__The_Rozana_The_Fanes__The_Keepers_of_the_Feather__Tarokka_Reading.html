<h3>I. The Legacy of the Rozana and the Path to the Spear</h3><p>The spirit of Kavan has deemed you worthy of his confidence. He has shared the ancient history of the land once known as Girvisa.</p><p><b>The Lore of the Fanes</b>
Long before Strahd’s arrival, the valley was protected by three archfey known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three:</p><ul><li><p>The Seeker: Master of the Mountain Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Weaver: Master of the Swamp Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Huntress: Master of the Forest Fane.</p></li></ul><p>Kavan claims that Strahd severed the Ladies from the land and claimed their power for himself, allowing him to truthfully declare, "I am the Land." As long as he remains bonded to these Fanes, his soul is anchored to the valley.</p><p><b>The Schism of the Folk</b>
Kavan describes a divide among his descendants:</p><ul><li><p>The Forest Folk: The druids who worship Strahd as the "Shadowed Lord."</p></li><li><p>The Mountain Folk: Kavan’s true kin who resisted Strahd and retreated to a hidden settlement called Soldav.</p></li></ul><p><b>Kavan’s Task: The Bloodline Spear</b>
To redeem his past arrogance, Kavan has directed you to retrieve his ancient weapon, now known as the Bloodline Spear:</p><ul><li><p>The Lead: The spear was claimed by King Dostron the Hellborn as Kavan lay dying.</p></li><li><p>The Goal: You must recover the spear and bring it to the Shrine of the Ladies Three in Soldav to be reconsecrated.</p></li></ul><p><b>The Path to Soldav</b>
To find the hidden Mountain Folk, you must travel into the Balinok Mountains and look for the Twin Falls. The entrance is shielded by enchanted mist; Kavan warns that without a token of the Ladies, the entrance will remain hidden.</p>
<h3>II. The Truth of the Keepers</h3><p>With the gemstone back in the Martikovs' hands, Davian Martikov and Muriel Vinshaw have shared the secrets of their order.</p><p><b>The Keepers of the Feather</b>
The Martikov family are wereravens and leaders of a secret society founded to undermine Strahd’s rule. They operate as a network of spies and providers of sanctuary. Muriel shared the tragic fate of her fiancé, Elric, who was lost to the experiments of Ludmilla Vilisevic within the castle walls.</p><p><b>The Legend of the Three Gems</b>
The winery’s success relies on three enchanted green gemstones. Each the size and shape of a pinecones.You have recovered one from the druid's of Yester Hill, but the others locations are unknown.</p><p><b>Your Reward: The Keeper’s Whistle</b>
Davian has gifted you an obsidian whistle. Once per day, you may use it to summon a wereraven agent to assist with scouting, delivering messages, or providing a distraction.</p>
<h3>III. The Threads of Fate: Your Tarokka Reading</h3><p>Madam Eva’s words serve as your only map through the fog, all the more shameful you've lost them to the fog of poor note keeping and fragile memories. Here are the prophecies revealed at the Tser Pool:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><b>Card 2</b></p></li></ol><ul><li><p>The Foretelling: 
"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."

</p></li><li><p>The Card: The Traitor.</p></li><li><p>The Prophecy: “The Nine of Glyphs the Traitor.” Her dark pupils shift from side to side, as though reading from an unseen text. "I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The lost soul will lead you to him."</p>

When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"</p></li><li><p>The Card: The Marionette.</p></li><li><p>The Prophecy: Madam Eva slowly exhales. "The Marionette.

<h3>I. The Legacy of the Rozana and the Path to the Spear</h3><p>The spirit of Kavan has deemed you worthy of his confidence. He has shared the ancient history of the land once known as Girvisa.</p><p><b>The Lore of the Fanes</b>
Long before Strahd’s arrival, the valley was protected by three archfey known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three:</p><ul><li><p>The Seeker: Master of the Mountain Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Weaver: Master of the Swamp Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Huntress: Master of the Forest Fane.</p></li></ul><p>Kavan claims that Strahd severed the Ladies from the land and claimed their power for himself, allowing him to truthfully declare, "I am the Land." As long as he remains bonded to these Fanes, his soul is anchored to the valley.</p><p><b>The Schism of the Folk</b>
Kavan describes a divide among his descendants:</p><ul><li><p>The Forest Folk: The druids who worship Strahd as the "Shadowed Lord."</p></li><li><p>The Mountain Folk: Kavan’s true kin who resisted Strahd and retreated to a hidden settlement called Soldav.</p></li></ul><p><b>Kavan’s Task: The Bloodline Spear</b>
To redeem his past arrogance, Kavan has directed you to retrieve his ancient weapon, now known as the Bloodline Spear:</p><ul><li><p>The Lead: The spear was claimed by King Dostron the Hellborn as Kavan lay dying.</p></li><li><p>The Goal: You must recover the spear and bring it to the Shrine of the Ladies Three in Soldav to be reconsecrated.</p></li></ul><p><b>The Path to Soldav</b>
To find the hidden Mountain Folk, you must travel into the Balinok Mountains and look for the Twin Falls. The entrance is shielded by enchanted mist; Kavan warns that without a token of the Ladies, the entrance will remain hidden.</p>
<h3>II. The Truth of the Keepers</h3><p>With the gemstone back in the Martikovs' hands, Davian Martikov and Muriel Vinshaw have shared the secrets of their order.</p><p><b>The Keepers of the Feather</b>
The Martikov family are wereravens and leaders of a secret society founded to undermine Strahd’s rule. They operate as a network of spies and providers of sanctuary. Muriel shared the tragic fate of her fiancé, Elric, who was lost to the experiments of Ludmilla Vilisevic within the castle walls.</p><p><b>The Legend of the Three Gems</b>
The winery’s success relies on three enchanted green gemstones. Each the size and shape of a pinecones.You have recovered one from the druid's of Yester Hill, but the others locations are unknown.</p><p><b>Your Reward: The Keeper’s Whistle</b>
Davian has gifted you an obsidian whistle. Once per day, you may use it to summon a wereraven agent to assist with scouting, delivering messages, or providing a distraction.</p>
<h3>III. The Threads of Fate: Your Tarokka Reading</h3><p>Madam Eva’s words serve as your only map through the fog, all the more shameful you've lost them to the fog of poor note keeping and fragile memories.

<h3>I. The Legacy of the Rozana and the Path to the Spear</h3><p>The spirit of Kavan has deemed you worthy of his confidence. He has shared the ancient history of the land once known as Girvisa.</p><p><b>The Lore of the Fanes</b>
Long before Strahd’s arrival, the valley was protected by three archfey known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three:</p><ul><li><p>The Seeker: Master of the Mountain Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Weaver: Master of the Swamp Fane.</p></li><li><p>The Huntress: Master of the Forest Fane.</p></li></ul><p>Kavan claims that Strahd severed the Ladies from the land and claimed their power for himself, allowing him to truthfully declare, "I am the Land." As long as he remains bonded to these Fanes, his soul is anchored to the valley.</p><p><b>The Schism of the Folk</b>
Kavan describes a divide among his descendants:</p><ul><li><p>The Forest Folk: The druids who worship Strahd as the "Shadowed Lord."</p></li><li><p>The Mountain Folk: Kavan’s true kin who resisted Strahd and retreated to a hidden settlement called Soldav.</p></li></ul><p><b>Kavan’s Task: The Bloodline Spear</b>
To redeem his past arrogance, Kavan has directed you to retrieve his ancient weapon, now known as the Bloodline Spear:</p><ul><li><p>The Lead: The spear was claimed by King Dostron the Hellborn as Kavan lay dying.</p></li><li><p>The Goal: You must recover the spear and bring it to the Shrine of the Ladies Three in Soldav to be reconsecrated.</p></li></ul><p><b>The Path to Soldav</b>
To find the hidden Mountain Folk, you must travel into the Balinok Mountains and look for the Twin Falls. The entrance is shielded by enchanted mist; Kavan warns that without a token of the Ladies, the entrance will remain hidden.</p>
<h3>II. The Truth of the Keepers</h3><p>With the gemstone back in the Martikovs' hands, Davian Martikov and Muriel Vinshaw have shared the secrets of their order.</p><p><b>The Keepers of the Feather</b>
The Martikov family are wereravens and leaders of a secret society founded to undermine Strahd’s rule. They operate as a network of spies and providers of sanctuary. Muriel shared the tragic fate of her fiancé, Elric, who was lost to the experiments of Ludmilla Vilisevic within the castle walls.</p><p><b>The Legend of the Three Gems</b>
The winery’s success relies on three enchanted green gemstones. Each the size and shape of a pinecones.You have recovered one from the druid's of Yester Hill, but the others locations are unknown.</p><p><b>Your Reward: The Keeper’s Whistle</b>
Davian has gifted you an obsidian whistle. Once per day, you may use it to summon a wereraven agent to assist with scouting, delivering messages, or providing a distraction.</p>
<h3>III. The Threads of Fate: Your Tarokka Reading</h3><p>Madam Eva’s words serve as your only map through the fog, all the more shameful you've lost them to the fog of poor note keeping and fragile memories.
