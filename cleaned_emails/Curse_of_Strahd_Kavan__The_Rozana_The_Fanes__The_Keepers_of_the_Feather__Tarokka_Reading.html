                    <div dir="ltr">It's not written here, but if I recall correctly, it was hinted that the "Bloodline Spear" counts as the kind of token we can show off to get into "Soldav".<br/>I'm pretty sure we were told that the pine cone gems work for that as well, but we don't want to have to take it away from the vineyard if we can avoid it.<div><div><br/></div><div>That means we almost sort of have the concept of a plan for what to do next!</div><div>- Get the spear from Castle Ravenloft (it's not stealing from Strahd, since it doesn't belong to him).  And we're invited there soon!</div><div>- Go to Soldav and reconsecrate the spear.</div><div>- This will (somehow?) help us restore three "Fanes", which will weaken Strahd in some unspecified way.  Besides being an awesome weapon vs Undead Vampire Egomaniacs.</div><div><br/></div><div>As for the prophecies, card 1 seems to have already occurred:</div><div>"I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The lost soul will lead you to him"<br/>Leo Whatshisnamya was an ancient foe of House Wächter.  And a lost soul led us to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>The remaining prophecies are irritatingly vague:</div><div><i>"The Five of Swords the Myrmidon.” Her eyes stare deep into the darkness that lurks beyond the candlelight.</i></div><div><i>    </i>Gee, thanks lady ... </div><div><i>"What you seek lies in an amber prison, where the devil fears to tread," she intones, her eyes narrowing. "This weapon is long hidden. The house of the fallen dragon can lead you there."</i></div><div>    This might be how to find the spear?  Look for an amber prison in Ravenloft?  </div><div>    Wasn't there some secret society of the silver dragon?  We could figure out what the "House of the fallen dragon" is, at least.</div><div><i>"A Vistani wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor... Seek her out at Saint Markovia’s Abbey, near the mists."</i></div><div>    St. Markovia's is the abbey near Krezik?  We're heading there anyway!</div><div><i>"The Marionette. Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby."</i></div><div>    Surely this will make sense when the time comes!</div><div><br/></div><div>We're going to Krezik anyway, they love us there, maybe we can nip off to the abbey and see if there are any Vistani there with helpful advice for us.  Or at least inscrutable prophecies which only ever make sense in retrospect!</div><div><br/></div></div></div><br/>
