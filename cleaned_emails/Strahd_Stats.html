Evil runs from me.<br/>I live for the thrill of the hunt.<br/>I kill monsters to make the world a safer place, and to exorcise my own demons. (Good)<br/>A terrible guilt consumes me. I hope that I can find redemption through my actions.<br/>I assume the worst in people.<br/>A walking cane with an iron ferule that strikes sparks<br/>on stone<br/>You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for<br/>a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and<br/>images are burned into your psyche.<br/>.<br/><br/>The Blackthorn family does not, precisely speaking, have a particularly high reputation, and the latest scion of that name, Friar Gregor Blackthorn, Knight Chaplain of the order of (X) is no exception.<br/><br/>It's said that madness and glory haunt the family; The Blackthorn family has always flirted with the divine and the arcane, however Gregor's sire five generations prior, was the real thing; a capable and renowned priest gifted with a knowledge cleric's psychometry. His offspring not so much. <br/><br/>In the shadow of a legend, his descendants pursued knowledge and power with devout, albeit often misguided fervor. Their zeal for surpassing their patriarchs renown often led them down paths darkened by ambition and vanity. Accusations (rightly laid) of charlatanism, heresy (not entirely inaccurately accused) and even dark consortations (It was a one time thing!) were not uncommon among the whispers spoken of the family.<br/><br/>Devout? Certainly. Voracious seekers of knowledge? Undoubtedly. Capable.. sometimes. Honest? Quite rarely. Sane? Well, that's in the seven eyes of the beholder.<br/><br/>Gregor channels this familial streak for exploration of the mystic into the monstrous. His decision to pledge a knightly order initially seemed a misstep, given his physical frailties. Yet, stubbornness (coupled with a handful of arcane secrets) and frankly, sheer hateful spite carved his path as a fearsome enforcer of divine law and retribution. Armed with a laughably mundane walking stick, he normally strikes an unimposing figure, at least until he connects.<br/><br/>Gregor's journey at first took a common track of priories and wandering parishes, hunting monstrosities with his brethren, at least until curiosity led him to an eldritch tome after the destruction of a particularly unpleasant creature. Rather than burn the tome as one wisely ought, he instead tried to claim the knowledge for his own. <br/><br/>He burned the book shortly afterwards; but forgetting is another tale.<br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></div><br/><div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_attr" dir="ltr">On Sat, Mar 16, 2024 at 12:22 AM Ben Jones &lt;<a href="mailto:theonlyalterego@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">theonlyalterego@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">Got them, thanks! <br/></div><br/><div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_attr" dir="ltr">On Sat, Mar 16, 2024 at 12:14 AM Edward Baird &lt;<a href="mailto:edward.r.baird@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edward.r.baird@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">13, 12, 13, 11, 7, 11<br/></div>
