                    <div dir="ltr">I'll take you up on that!  I have a feeling that Rachel is going to need all the luck she can get ...<div><br/></div><div>We visited the Vistani camp at the Tser Pools last session.  It seems a pleasant enough location, in a pretty clearing in the woods, near the river and lakes.  The Vistani were friendly and charming hosts, inviting us to dinner and to gamble our valuables, and also to visit Madam Eva for a fortune telling.  This had been our intention anyway, to try and find out how we could keep Ireena safe.</div><div><br/></div><div>Madam Eva was appropriately helpful and interesting.  As far as Ireena is concerned, the safest place is a truly holy site.  The Chapel in Barovia might not be enough, it's run down and there isn't a lot of faith there any more.  Eva recommended a church in a nearby city called Vallakai instead, which is likely our next destination.  But she also pointed out, as tactfully as possible, that Strahd tends to get what Strahd wants.  The only way Ireena will ever be truly safe is if Strahd is destroyed.  The Vistani enjoy privileges in this realm and aren't going to cross Strahd.</div><div><br/></div><div>She also hinted, specifically to me, that she had more to tell, in private, and would meet me at midnight at the gallows.  Gulp.  I'd been rather hoping to avoid going back there if I could help it.  She flat-out told us that there was a shadowy servant of darkness approaching her tent, who was trying to learn whatever special secret <i>about me</i> that Madam Eva is going to share.  (When we looked, we saw two Vistani, Eliza and Arturi, loitering around).  Rachel and Francis are plotting to sneak out of camp as Midnight approaches.  We have not yet decided whether to enlist the rest of you guys for this.  Sorry, some of you just aren't that sneaky.  But I'll need the help of someone I can trust (Rachel trusts Francis with her life) to ensure privacy and make sure this "shadow" doesn't hear about my future.  Who is it?  Rachel thinks it's probably Mr. "I've been haunted by undead for 18 years" Arturi.</div><div><br/></div><div>Rachel and Eva spoke about the countryside and scenery in this realm.  She's beginning to suspect that Strahd invited us here for a reason, and what reason to invite an up-and-coming painter if not to paint something extraordinary?  Eva said that Strahd himself is by far the most notable entity to be found this side of the Gates.  "He is the land".<br/>Valen wondered, if I'm here to paint, why are the rest of us here?  I'll tell you guys later how much canvas weighs.  Strahd is an egomaniac and a portrait would need to be larger-than-life, probably castle-wall-sized, and likely hung behind his Throne.  I'll need a frame large enough to hold up that canvas, a massive easel, obviously a stepladder, and all of that needs to be carried by people with a Strength score higher than mine.  Not to mention that I am no longer an Apprentice, I am a full Guild member and no longer need to mix my own paints, clean my own brushes, I'll need someone to fetch tea, pie, and anything else I need ... four helpers might not even be enough.</div><div>Good news is, I think I know how to get us into Castle Ravenloft, if needed.</div><div><br/></div><div>After our fortune session, we had dinner and played Liar's Storytelling Hour, where we wagered more-or-less valuable items on how well we could tell if stories were true or not.  Some might have thought that Gregor was guessing wildly, one might even say randomly, but he was clearly guided by whatever nameless God he worships and won the evening with a nearly perfect record.  Nice.  He told a creepy story which seems to be about murdering his former companions.  I really hope that's fiction, but if so it's disturbingly detailed.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><br/>
