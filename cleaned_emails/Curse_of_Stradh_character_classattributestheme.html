                    <div dir="ltr"><div>My DM Assistant suggests these:</div><div><br/></div><div>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, a few builds can effectively utilize thrown weapons, although they may not match the sustained ranged power of an archer-style character (like a Ranger). However, some classes and subclasses can be optimized for thrown weapons with a bit of tweaking. Here are some options:<br/><br/>### 1. **Fighter (Battle Master or Champion)**<br/>   - **Battle Master**: This subclass offers great flexibility for a thrown-weapon build. The *Precision Attack* maneuver can help you overcome the lower attack bonuses associated with thrown weapons, while *Quick Toss* (from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*) lets you make a thrown weapon attack as a bonus action. *Sharpshooter* feat can also help increase damage output.<br/>   - **Champion**: The *Improved Critical* feature is useful for maximizing damage over time with frequent attacks.<br/><br/>### 2. **Rogue (Thief or Swashbuckler)**<br/>   - **Thief**: This subclass can be quite effective, especially with the *Fast Hands* feature, which can allow more thrown attacks or utility on the battlefield.<br/>   - **Swashbuckler**: The Swashbuckler's *Fancy Footwork* lets you get in close, throw a dagger, and disengage without opportunity attacks. A combination of sneak attack damage with thrown weapons like daggers or handaxes can work, though it requires setting up advantageous positions.<br/><br/>### 3. **Barbarian (Path of the Berserker or Path of the Beast)**<br/>   - **Berserker**: The *Frenzy* feature lets you make extra attacks with thrown weapons when raging, though the downside of exhaustion is something to watch out for.<br/>   - **Path of the Beast**: At level 3, you gain the ability to create natural thrown weapons with the *Form of the Beast* feature. This adds flexibility and flavor, and the weapons return to your hand after being thrown.<br/><br/>### 4. **Ranger (Hunter or Gloom Stalker)**<br/>   - **Hunter**: The *Colossus Slayer* or *Horde Breaker* features add extra damage to attacks, including thrown weapon attacks.<br/>   - **Gloom Stalker**: The Gloom Stalker’s extra attack in the first round of combat is great for burst damage, and with thrown weapons, this can give you a solid opening strike.<br/><br/>### 5. **Monk (Kensei)**<br/>   - **Kensei**: With *Kensei's Shot* and the ability to make ranged attacks with monk weapons (like daggers or darts), the Kensei monk can be a highly mobile, ranged combatant who uses thrown weapons. The martial arts dice can be leveraged for high damage.<br/><br/>### Feats to Consider:<br/>   - **Sharpshooter**: Normally for ranged weapons, but if your DM rules that thrown weapons count, this can help negate disadvantage from long-range throws and boost damage.<br/>   - **Dual Wielder**: Can be used to dual-wield thrown weapons like daggers or handaxes.<br/>   - **Tavern Brawler**: Gives proficiency with improvised weapons and lets you make thrown attacks with them.<br/><br/>A Fighter (Battle Master) or Ranger (Hunter) would be the closest to an archer-like playstyle with thrown weapons, but with careful build choices, you can create an effective thrown-weapon character with other classes as well.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Again, I'm open to all extra sources as long as you come up with a workable class with well defined rules.<br/></div></div><br/>
