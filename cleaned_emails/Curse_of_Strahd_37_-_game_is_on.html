                    <div dir="ltr">What's this?  Do we need a large amount of text?  Sufficient to cover a large surface, maybe even the side of a building or a barrier??<div>*cracks knuckles*</div><div><img alt="image.png" height="188" src="images/ii_m8ii9k770.jpg" width="250"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Disclaimer:  This is all from my (that is, Rachel's) memory, as I am working under two disadvantages:  First, I don't actually remember which sessions Evan has missed, and second, I can't access our in-game notes while the Fantasy Grounds game is offline (the biggest, possibly the only, drawback of Fantasy Grounds).</div><div><br/></div><div>Anyway.  Valen was definitely with us for the House of Durst, so I'll start with when we entered the Gate to this terrible place.</div><div><br/></div><div>DAY 1</div><div>We'd spent the night outside the gate, and were hoping to find a cheerful town where we could stay for a while and recover.  Instead, we found a mist-covered, gloomy forest, and a corpse bearing a note, telling us (I'm paraphrasing here) to stay away from a town called Barovia, wait until everyone was dead, then loot the place.  Naturally, we headed straight for Barovia.  </div><div>Not at all shockingly, Barovia turned out to be a dreary and depressing location, with overpriced goods, unfriendly locals, and only one redeeming quality:  A kind, one might say saintly, old lady selling pie!  At one gold per pastry, they weren't cheap, but oh my did it hit the spot.  Everyone except Artur, who can be a suspicious-minded fuddy-duddy sometimes, bought pie, and enjoyed it as much as we've enjoyed anything in this cold and gray realm.</div><div>At the inn, we enjoyed lukewarm tea and watery beer, and met Isstmark, the son of the Burgomaster and the one who had sent the note from before.  Undead horrors had been attacking his home night after night.  His father had been killed, and he was worried about his sister, Ireena, who the leader of this Realm, Lord Strahd, had been trying to kidnap.  Isstmark was preparing to defend his sister the only way he knew how; by drinking one beer after another in a tavern while waiting for someone to help him out.  Lucky for him we arrived when we did.</div><div><br/></div><div>That night, we fortified their house and defended it against a literal horde of zombies.  Once we had killed all of them, their leader, an Elf on horseback, arrived and told us that he would spare us, and that Strahd declared that the rebellion was over.  That's one way to win, I guess.</div><div><br/></div><div>DAY 2</div><div>We woke before dawn for a special ceremony to bury the old Burgomaster in the hallowed ground of the town Chapel, which would protect him from being raised as undead.  We had some trouble with the Pastor, who was suffering mental health issues after his son was punished for his part in the recent uprising.  (We spotted his son in the basement, crawling on the ceiling, howling about how hungry he was for blood, and staying out of the light, and deduced that he had been affected by a vampire.  Rachel has the Eye of an Artist, you can't get much past me!).  We gave him a pep talk and convinced him to come up with us.  He seemed better, at least for the time being.</div><div>Ireena was worried about staying in Barovia, and wanted to consult a Vistani wise woman, Madam Eva, about how to stay safe.  We wanted to stock up on Pie for the road, but sadly the kindly old pie lady was nowhere to be seen.  We hit the road, spoke to some hunters who were looking for a missing family, dispatched some zombies matching the description of said family, bantered a bit with Strahd (who was, ah, out and about in his carriage during the day ...), and found the Vistani camp, where we were generously put up for the evening.  We had dinner, told some stories at the campfire, and Madam Eva arranged to meet us at the crossroads at midnight.  She warned us of a spy who would try to follow us.</div><div>We thought we'd chased off the spy, an otherwise friendly Vistani woman, but she found us again.  Madam Eva was furious and demanded that we kill her, for our own safety.  At Midnight, the Crossroads comes alive with the ghosts of those who have been murdered by Strahd - an endless column of misery, walking the road toward Castle Ravenloft.  Really drives home what a shitmuffin he is.  Eva also handed us some money to buy her great-(great? great-great? How old <i>is </i>this lady?) grand-nice a toy for her upcoming birthday.  We solemnly spoke a few words and committed the body of the spy to the river ... before frantically snatching her back after realizing that we'd forgotten to loot her corpse.</div><div><br/></div><div>DAY 3</div><div>We hastily left the Vistani camp before anyone noticed that anyone was missing.  Presumably Madam Eva will cover for us.  </div><div>We walked the long trek towards Vallakai, dealing with Wolves, more wolves, some werewolves, a surprisingly polite and accommodating revenant, and a bridge over a massive waterfall.  Lunch was provided by our dear friend, Pie Lady - sadly, all she had left were meat pies, both of which she sold at a significant discount to Gregor.  It turns out that she lives in what appears to be a creepy, abandoned windmill.  Surely the inside is a wonderous realm of baking magic.</div><div>Ireena had an ominous moment of deja-vu as we passed the shore of Lake Zarovitch(?), spotting a beach which she'd described the night before as being from a dream.  She has never been outside of Barovia, at least not that she remembers, but perhaps the family traveled this road to Vallakai when she was a small child.  </div><div>We arrived at Vallakai towards evening, and found a large encampment of refugees from Barovia camped outside the gates.  They'd been attacked repeatedly, by wild beasts of the forest, and by some kind of fire-blasting wiz, ah, "Sorcerer" with a twisted devil's arm.  (Note:  The description is ambiguous, it's unclear if the man's actual arm is twisted and devil-like, or if his arms are normal and he's wielding a twisted arm, Vecna-style, as a weapon.  The refugees have been evasive on this point).</div><div>We spent the night fending off attacks, first from great clouds of swarming bats, then by wolves, led by a terrifying werewolf.  Took four silver crossbow bolts to kill it!</div><div><br/></div><div>DAY 4</div><div>We paid our toll and entered Vallakai.  (Did Valen also pay?).  We had an excellent breakfast of glorious fresh bread, cheese, and butter at the local inn, where Rachel booked a room at the amazingly reasonable rate of 1 copper piece.  I intend to host a feast here tonight and you are all welcome to join. The proprietoress has not often cooked vegetarian meals, but seems up for the challenge.  Rachel is hoping for some potato soup, perhaps some roasted leeks and mushrooms, maybe a spiced cheese souffle, which I intend to pair with some of the interesting-sounding wines which I declined for breakfast.  If there are some honeycakes for dessert, I might just have to stay here.</div><div>We then purchased two toys from Blinsky, the John Wayne Gacy of Vallakai.  </div><div><br/></div><div>Our plans for the rest of the day [aka the upcoming session] are, in no particular order,</div><div>- Visit the nearby Vistani camp and deliver the toy</div><div>- Bring Ireena to the Church and try to assess how safe she'll be there</div><div>- PIE FOR LUNCH!  The nice pie lady makes sure that the refugees don't go hungry, so we know where she'll be.  Not sure if we'll have to pay a toll again if we leave town, but surely we can come and go as we please.</div><div>- Convince the Baron to let the refugees come inside the gates.  Rachel expects him to be an unrepentant dickhole with no sense of solidarity for his fellow human beings.  But even the most thick-headed ogre-like boot-wearing neckbeard of a human has to realize that leaving dozens to a hundred or so people to the mercy of vampire bats and werewolves will eventually lead to dozens to a hundred or so vampires and werewolves attacking his town, which even he has to imagine will be a bad thing.</div><div>- Feast at the inn!</div><div>- A decent night's sleep!  Because writing this up has made it clear that we haven't had an uninterrupted night's rest since we went to bed in the Weary Traveler Tavern, and awoke in a misty ruin.</div><div><br/></div><div>Also, to Artur, and also to Valen and Gregor:  I owe all three of you an apology.  I had no idea that the word "Wizard" was somehow insulting or derogatory.  In Hobyltan, it just meant "Wise person who casts spells", a male version of a Witch.  I never intended to insult any of you, but I will be happy to call you all "Sorcerers" from here on.  I feel terrible about the hurt I caused you, and I hope that the fact that it was entirely unintentional will earn your forgiveness.</div></div><br/>
