                    <p>(Journal kept by Rachel today, because Vaelen is off doing Wizard stuff and not speaking to anybody)Woke up this morning at the huge, creepy gates. Time to start searching for that Inn we were talking about. Hotcakes and syrup sounds like a much better breakfast than hardtack and nothing.We found a road sign at the gates, this is the Old Svalich Road to a town called Barovia.The gates closed behind us after we entered. Ominous. We continued down the road, through a dense and creepy wood.We found a corpse in the woods, carrying a satchel with a sealed letter, the wax marked with a letter B. He seemed to have been attacked by wolves. A note accompanying the letter read:"Dalvin - leave this by the gate".Gregor assumed that the "B" was for "Blackthorn" and that the letter was addressed to him. He was right, sort of:Handout: Kolyan Indirovich's Letter v2The Burgomaster speaks of a great evil and wants us to avoid his town.We continued down the road to Barovia. The village looks small and poor, and surrounded by fields of stunted corn. The mists make the whole countryside gray and depressing. But a pie vendor we met in town sold us some of the greatest pies we've ever seen. Everyone except Artur had some and enjoyed it very much.There is in fact a tavern in Barovia, although the tea and beer were watery and questionable. Didn't attempt the food yet. We met a gentleman named Ismark, the son of the Burgomaster, with whom we chatted at the tavern. Ismark hinted at a great danger facing his sister. He brought us to the Burgomaster's house, which seems to have been under siege recently.The Burgomaster had died the night before. Ireena wants to bury him tomorrow at dawn, and asked us to help guard the house over night. They're worried about someone named Strahd taking them. We plan to spend the night at the mansion, helping to defend the Mayor's corpse until he can be properly buried.We went to the local church to try and figure out what's been going on and what we can do about it. Father Donavich let us in. The church was a shambles and had clearly been attacked recently. We heard a voice come from underneath the floorboards, talking about how hungry it was. Father Donavich was not mentally stable and it was difficult to talk to him and get any information out of him. But it seems that his son, Doru, had been turned into a Vampire a year before, during a failed rebellion against Castle Ravenloft. Doru was locked in the church basement and was the voice we'd heard earlier.We decided to leave the church be, and spend the rest of our daylight fortifying the Mayor's house.</p>

                    <p>We walked back from the church to the Burgomaster's house, looking over some supplies at Bildrath's wildly overpriced general store on the way.Bildrath mentioned a Black Mage who'd come through decades before, leading a revolution against Strahd. Apparently Strahd does not react well to defiance and punished the town by slaughtering random peasants for days.It seems this is happening again. Strahd's minions have been ravaging this town for the past days. The town is likely very dangerous at night. We've talked about going somewhere safer, but Ireena won't leave until her father is safely buried.After a brief discussion on whether or not to even help Ismark and Ireena, we proceeded to the Burgomaster's mansion. We fortified as well as we could, and awaited the arrival of Strahd's zombie horde.We fought off wave after wave of zombies, until a massive hideous blob of an undead horror, stinking of death, crashed through the gate.After a hugely difficult fight, the yard was littered with dead zombies and the splattered plague spreader. None made it inside the house. A pale elf on a horse rode up to the gate, proclaiming himself to be an emmissary of Strahd. He announced that the Burgomaster's insurrection was over, that the town had suffered enough, and that Strahd, "in his mercy", would leave anyone alone who returned to their homes and stood down.Tomorrow at dawn, we'll bury the Burgomaster in hallowed ground. Rachel's entire plan after that is to (1) take a nap; (2) get some more of that pie; (3) more nap; (4) more pie; and finally (5) Assume by then that Francis will have some kind of plan to get out of this terrible place and back home.Ireena mentioned that she would consult a local fortune teller after burying her father. Perhaps she might have some advice for us as well.</p>

                    <p>No brooms were harmed over the first night, our first in Barovia.Ismark told the story of Doro's rebellion. About three months ago, Doro tried to storm Castle Ravenloft with a group of followers. Nobody has seen him since. Although we heard him yesterday afternoon ...We accompanied Ismark to the Church. Father Donovitch explained: "Doro came back two days ago, sent by Strahd. He's been turned into a Vampire, and has my Holy Symbol. He's in control of himself! He wants a chance! He can't fully resist Strahd, but he can control his actions. He allowed me to bring him to the basement. He has my holy symbol".Doro was surprisingly receptive to us. He said that he was feeling much better today, that he'd been under Strahd's control until just this morning. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to control his bloodlust. We gave him a test, and while he was sorely tempted, he concentrated on prayer and his father's holy symbol, and recovered. He now looks and acts like a normal person! And he gave us a book! And told us the story of his ill-fated rebellion and the terrible doom they found in Castle Ravenloft.Father Donovitch agreed to perform the proper ceremonies for the Burgomaster.Ismark suggested that we escort Ireena to Madam Eva, a Vistani fortune teller, near the Tser Pools about an hour outside of town, or the next town on the road called Krezzik.We also agreed to keep an eye out for Mary, a lost village girl, who went to find "Her prince in a castle". Her mother offered us a doll. Another side quest to find a lost family in the woods.We found the lost family. They were zombies :(</p>

                    <p>Taking a short rest. (1 hr)We learn Rachel saw herself in the gallows. She thinks that strahd brought her here to paint for him.But why did he bring the rest of us?Thinking back we have seen no sunlight since we have passed the large stone gates.We also take some time to read our guide on vampires.https://voltor.narod.ru/vr/vr01_00.htm Van Richten's Guide to Vampires (Pinned in discord)We continue down the trail to find a Vistani village and are greeted by Stanimir.Image: DM Map - Tser Pool EncampmentShared Asset: StanimirWe get to the Encampment and are greeted again by Eliza. We accept a drink, and are turned down to trade.We get a run-down of points of interest. To the west is Valakai and another gate and Cresk. To the south a mountain (g?). Ravenloft is close to us here near the next crossroads.Other adventurers have been seen here before.Rachel spots the Raven, and believes we have made a friend.We meet Madam Eva. Ireena is given the floor.Shared Asset: Madam EvaMadam Eva gives us advice to go to a church and to find a holy place. But ultimately it is a match of wills. And the only way to 100% succeed is to Destroy Strahd.We learn the Visani earned favor with Strahd in the past and he lets them leave the mist.Madam Eva promised a fortune in the gallows.As we are leaving Madam Eva speaks and tells us:"A shadow is approaching my tent: a lone servant of Darkness. They seek knowledge of your future—secrets that I am sworn never to reveal to any but their keepers.“Do not look, child, nor rush to greet them; if they learn of your true aspirations, all may be lost. Do not reveal, even, that you know of their true nature, for their master will know that I have told you, and his wrath will descend upon us all.As we exit we see two Vistani waiting outside. Eliza and Arturi. We meet Distin at the camp and play high-low.True or False game at the campfire. Tell a story and others bet on if its true or false.First True story of the backstory of Vistani.Gregor wins (with us guessing as him)Rachel attempts to talk to arturiHe is pursued by undead every night.

We walk south along the river to investigate.We find some footsteps and a spot where a fight might have happened or went to the trees, possibly an animal or druid. No real answers here.We investigate the ring a little more to see if it gives us any more answers.The ring has symbols of evocation and necromancy but no one can discern more.Item: Signet Ring (Plot Item)Ultimately we are meeting eh Baron tomorrow and might try to see if he has a library we can use to investigate further.We walk back to the vistani camp and walk along the other side.We are unable to find entrances in and out of valakai without paying the fee.We take a long rest at the Inn and all get our own roomsIdentify gets us that the Signet ring is magical, but nothing really more.WE head to the barons estate:WE trade help expelling a ghost from the estate for access to the library and start exploring and talking to the staff.We head to th</p>

                    <p>After dinner and story time, we pitched out tents for the evening. Shortly before midnight, we snuck out of camp toward the Gallows.On the way, we encountered Eliza, who had been following us out of camp. We also saw a floating blue light in the woods, and chose not to spend time chasing it.Eliza managed to stealthily follow us to the crossroads, but Madam Eva spotted her. We chased her down.At midnight, spirits rose from the graveyard by the gallows. Hundreds of dead heroes, all those who had fallen challenging Strahd.Quest Aquired! We have been commissioned to purchase a toy for Eva's great-grand niece, Arabella. We have two days to buy a toy in Blinsky's Toys in Vallakai. Apparently she's a delightful little girl, and we're invited to also chat with her father, Luvash, and uncle Arrigal. She gave Francis some money to buy the toy.Eva draws five cards to tell our fortune:History: Knowledge of the Ancient will help you better understand your enemy. It's "The Traitor". 9 of Glyphs. "I see the ancient foe of a noble house. The lost soul will lead you to him"."This card shows protection, a holy symbol of great hope"It's "The Myrmidon", 5 of Swords. "Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night""This is a card of power and strenth, a sword of sunlight""The Bishop", 8 of Glyphs. "What you seek lies in a prison of darkness, beyond a set of amber doors. This weapon is long hidden. The house of the fallen dragon can lead you there""This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly lin the battle against darkness:"The Mists" Queen of Spades "A Vistani wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. Seek her out at Saint Markova's Abbey near the mists""Your enemy is a creature of darkness whose powers are beyond mortality""Marionette" "The Jack of Hearts. Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby"Eva seemed to react very badly to this card. She seemed terrified.We took a blank log book from her corpse and and set Eliza to rest in the river.Item: Eliza's Log Book</p>

                    <p>We arose early the next morning, took our leave, and hit the road to Vallakai. We walked through hilly, nearly mountainous country, and the road got progressively worse. We passed an abandoned watch tower, and saw two fresh graves and a dead wolf.We saw movement in the woods - Gregor said it was a living wolf - and soon spotted a full wolf pack approaching us. We fought them off, but then noticed two huge, hulking wolves observing us with an eerie calm and concentration. Gregor consulted his pamphlet and believes that they are werewolves.On a bridge over a massively deep chasm, we met a grim guardian blocking our way. He demanded to know if we served Strahd. He introduced himself as Sir Godfrey Willem, and "he awaits those who would raise their swords against those in the Castle's depths". He was cast out by his lord, a revenent, oath-bound by his commander to stand watch until his task is done. He must stand watch until his honor is restored. His commander, Vladimir Hornguard, is in a place called Argon Grosholt, west of "The Walled City". His sigil was a dragon, etched in silver on his armor, indicating that he is a Knight of the Silver Dragon. He has been forbidden by his commander from raising arms against the Lord of the Land. He can be relased from his eternal torment only by his commander.At a crossroads, we saw a gate to the west, winding up through the hills and mountains. The road to the east seemed to lead to Castle Ravenloft. The ancient rusted gate swung open for us. This one did not close behind us. We continued through a mountainous valley, interspersed with patches of woods. We saw a windmill, and an ancient stone slab, carved with an icon of a raven over three stars, which I sketched out quickly.The road continues down from the mountains into a creepy woods. A raven seemed to have been following us as we approached the town of Vallakai. A break in the woods gave us a view of Lake Zarovich - strangely, Ireena recognized the shore as the beach from her dream. We spotted a hidden figure in the woods, and generally had a strange feeling of being watched. Perhaps not only by the ravens following us.We approached a clearing in the woods, notable for being on a map. A map which we'll likely see next session.</p>

                    <p>We continued along the ominous road to Vallakai, when we were suddenly ambushed by wolves, and then two werewolves. Francis and Gregor were injured, but otherwise seem to be okay.The werewolves turned into young men, who we buried by the endge of the forest. I sketched their faces, maybe someone in town might know them.We bound Francis' wounds as best we could, and continued on toward town."A sullen mountain burg, surrounded by a wooden palisade"Image: Map - VallakiRefugees from Barovia seemed to be living in tents outside the palisade walls. We approached the gate and spoke with some of the people. Emerick and Magda, a couple around a campfire, seemed to recognize Ireena. They haven't been allowed into Vallakai. When they arrived, some of them tried to enter by foce, and a wizard named Isaac blasted them away. Since then, they've been living in a tent village. The Baron has decreed that refugees may not enter, out of concern for sickness, violence, or "aggressive unhappiness". They've been attacked by wolves and bats.We plan to spend the night outside the gates, defending these people over night.We made common cause with the refugees, and organized them into a more defensible formation. We await nightfall and the inevitable attacks. Around midnight, clouds of bats descended from the misty skies and set upon the refugees. We destroyed the bats, with some impressive fire spells from "Artur the Wolf-Slayer".</p>

I'm starting to understand how the refugees were so injured when we arrived. Tactics were discussed.The rest of the night passed uneventfully.The next morning, the guards still insisted on collecting the entrance fee, claiming that they dare not defy their Baron, Vargas Vallakovich. We paid to enter and headed to the Blue Water Inn.Francis and I ordered tea. Artur tried Purple Grapemash #3. We also met the bartender, Urlwin Martikov, and his wife Danika, as well as some colorful locals.Image: The Martikov FamilyShared Asset: Rictavio"Is no fun? Is no Blinsky!". We set off for the toy store.Image: Gadof BlinskyAll of the toys look like they were made by a demented serial killer.

                    <p>We approached the closed, glyphed door in the attic. A glyph set off a blast of fear, but we stood firm.Behind the door was a small apartment, with many books, scrolls, and an undead skeletal cat. And, it turns out, an invisible kid necromancer:Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »The Mayor's son, Viktor.We proposed that he knock off with the haunting stuff. He claimed that, while some of it might have been his spellcasting practice, there really is a ghost and it's associated with the mirror downstairs.We agreed to bring the mirror upstairs for an exorcism.The symbol on his book belonged to a wizard named Kazan. Viktor is seeking Kazan's Tower in the forest. (Or rather, thinking of seeking Kazan's Tower; he dislikes going out into the woods).Quest Aquired! Soldar Soldarvic is a wolf hunter who can guide us in the forest. He wants us to go to Kazan's Tower and recover him an artifact, particularly a wizard's staff."There is a hidden clue: The tower is located on the western side of the lake. There is a gravel causeway on lake Baratok to the west. Perhaps you can take this information to Soldar"Valen accessed the library. We convinced the Baron to give us each a gate pass, and will no longer be paying a toll at the gates.Valen borrowed a book from the Baron's library, by Mordenkainen, on spirits and entities:Item: Ethereal Entities Denizens of the Unseen Realm by Mordenkainen"There's a famous name"A crossroads, to Krezek, Vallakai, and the Wizard of the Wines vineyard. Instead, we followed the shore to Kazan's tower. By the causeway, we found a wagon, splattered with mud.The wagon belongs to one Ezmerelda D'Avenir. Creepy, with a smell of sulfur and lots of footprints from humans and wolves. Lots of "Keep Away" signs.When we opened the door, we were immediately attacked by a silver net, and some kind of napalm-like chemical fire which absolutely blasted Francis.The tower door was carved with the name "Kazan":Image: Tower DoorThe symbol was similar to what we found on the ring.Inside, four clay figures were holding chains, which seemed to raise and lower a platform. they raised or lowered the platform when asked politely.On the top floor, we found a child-sized charm bracelet, wrapped around a dagger and the "Hooded One" Tarokka card, representing mysteries, newcomers, and hidden identities.Papers had been burned in the stove. We found a partial journal entry, and a flyer for Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders.---The Journal:For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; "sage" and "master hunter" I am called in others. That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.---The bed had been slept in recently. We noticed a patch of yellow lily pads in the lake below.I grabbed a ruler off of the desk on the top floor. Maybe Viktor can make a wand out of it.</p>

                    <p>We decided to check out the lily pads, which were close to the tower island, adjacent to the causeway. The leaves, and rocks near shore, were covered with yellow paint. Buckets of paint had been dumped there. The yellow paint looked very similar to the carnival wagon we'd seen in Vallakai, "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders", outside the coffinmaker's shop which had been taken over by a vampire.Artur volunteered to dive in and grab some pots. He complained about the duckweed trying to grapple him, but succeessfully roped the pots. They were too heavy for us, but not for the four clay golems.All of the pots were chained together, and we also got a bonus small waterproof chest, containing four unmagical vials of clear water.We searched the wagon again. An untrapped chest contained medium-sized adult human women's clothing. Underneath a false bottom, we found a climber's kit, a disuise kit, a poisoner's kit, tarokka cards, manacles, and another small wooden chest, some scrolls, and a map of Barovia. We identified the scrolls as Major Image and Remove Curse.The chicken ... is ... Eggsmerelda.We tracked the second wagon to a clearing to the southwest. We found signs that the wagon may have been painted about 3 days ago, in colors very similar to Rictavio's wagon.Only then did Rachel remember that Lancelot can track stuff too. Who needs a hunter.Shared Asset: lancelotWoot! He found the scent! We followed! He dragged us along the cart path to Vallakai. Straight to Rictavio's wagon. And to Rictavio himself:Shared Asset: RictavioAs flamboyant as ever. He was carrying a package of food, which he claimed was for hi "Tiger". Artur and Gregor brought him to the bar. Rachel confidently went to the wagon and walked right in:Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »I was shocked, shocked! To find a kidnapped little girl there.Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Turns out that she'd been rescued, not kidnapped. Rachel returned to the inn with Hana the Tiger. Yan had kidnapped her and wanted to sell her to a Vampire named Escher. Rictavio, who was obviously Dr. Van Richten, saved her, hid her at the tower for a while until it was attacked by werewolves, then took the guise of Rictavio to hide her in Vallakai. We spoke with him at length, about Vampires, Strahd, and Barovia."It's a shitty place, and it's good for Vampires"The session ended when Arrugal showed up. He'd been following us and was convinced we knew where Arabelle was. We calmed him down to the point where we could talk to each other, but we'll have to resolve this.(and I TOLD you guys there's a secret passage into town!!!)</p>

                    <p>We spoke with Arrugal and "Rictavio", explaining why we were keeping Arabelle's location secret, and about the bounty and Escher. He would surely be convinced after some light speaking-with-dead.We also spotted a "Wanted for Information" poster, displaying Ireena. Quite worrisome.Anyway, Gregor took the Talisman of Echoes and prepared to speak with Yan.Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »The Talisman of Echoes has four charges. For one charge, it can cast Speak with Dead, or Gentle Repose. It regains charges at dawn, and if all charges are used, it has a chance to be destroyed.Arrugal: "What Lord did you serve in Life?""The Vampire, Strahd von Zahrovitch"Me: "Why did Strahd put a bounty on Arabelle?""I do not know""Does Strahd have any other spies in the Vistani camp?""I do not know""How did Strahd contact you?""He bade me via compulsion to bring the girl to the river""How did you die?""A blade sliced my head from my shoulders from behind"I visited Arabelle, she wrote a note to her father. She spontaneouly chanted a prophecy:"In darkest nigt, the light shall flee,No dawn to break, with no reprieve.From the grave, the dead shall climb,Their restless march a baleful sign.At castle’s peak, a heart beats red,Its hunger deep and ever-fed.Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,A thousand souls in torment black."I brought Arabelle's letter, bought some makeup and cosmetics for Ireena.Artur went to the church for the night. Gregor, Francis, and I went with Arrugal to the Vistani camp. Arrugal spoke with Luvash for a bit, then gestured for us to join them. We managed to convince Luvash of our plan, and will set up an ambush in the wooden clearing."Rachel and her esteemed Adventurers" were invited to breakfast by Lady Wachter (??). The Wachters are an old and established noble house in Vallakai:--------------------------------Invitation:I hope this missive finds you in good health and high spirits. Vallaki appears to have been blessed by your presence and the promise of goodwill you bear with you.It has come to my attention that our paths, though they wind through such trying times, bear a striking convergence. Accordingly, I write to you today with a humble invitation to dine at my home, Wachterhaus, at sunrise tommorrow morning. You may find it on Vallaki’s northern road, a short distance from the Zarovich Gate.I trust that this setting shall provide a quiet and welcoming environment to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern. My doors, as they have always been, stand open to those who wish for the best for the good people of Barovia.Should you choose to accept, simply present this invitation at the door to my estate. I gladly await your presence tomorrow evening. Until then, I remain,Sincerely yours,Lady Fiona Wachter--------------------------------"Stella has wandered off". Nicolai takes her for a walk.Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Lady Wachter made small talk, and didn't seem to think much of the upcoming happiness festival. Apparently they're almost weekly now.She spoke of Isaac, who was orphaned after a wolf attack which killed his sister and took his arm. He got that devil arm when he was around 15. She thinks he's the "Strong Arm" of Baron Vargas and maybe behind the madness of the festivals. She carefully hinted that if Isaac disappeared, the Burgomaster would be diminished and some other leader could be elected. (She clearly had some ideas on who this should be).She revealed that Izek was a notorious drinker, and she could let us know when he was "vulnerable". We were quite agreeable to her idea of a coup. Generally I'm not big on assassination, but we might make an exception in Izek's case.We met Ernst, Lady Fiona's Butler, for lunch at the Blue Water Inn.Izek has lunch at the town square. Teresqa, the Baron's cook, brings him two bottles of wine and a meal. He sometimes speaks with his informers. He carries the bottles around with him, sipping all afternoon. He heads to the gates to take in reports. In the evening, he heads up north to the lake to drink alone.Lady Fiona provided a poisoned bottle of Red Dragon Crush.Returning to our original plan, we set up an ambush in the woods to flush out Strahd's spies.</p>

                    <p>We set up our ambush - Rachel in a tent, Gregor pretending (or "pretending") to fall asleep as a lazy guard, and Francis, Artur, and Valen hiding in the woods. Arrugal and Luvash spread a rumor that Arabelle was being kept in this place in the woods.We waited for several uneventful hours.Two men approached, apparently hunters, and chatted with Gregor for a while. Then they turned into werewolves and shared a pot of tea?No, they attacked us, and then called for help from four more werewolves.We killed the first two werewolves, the other four ran away. Great for now, probably going to be a problem later. They seem to be grudge-holders.</p>

                    <p>We returned to our camp site and set up our ambush again. Hours passed, and the light became dim, then dark.We were awakened by the sound of many bat wings. They swarmed out of the sky to our campfire. We got jumped by a wight, then more bats showed up, and then a Strix.At no point did anyone attempt to kidnap "Arabella". We waited throughout the morning, and decided that our kidnapping plan was a bust.We returned to town, to find that Izek had plundered the inn and church, capturing Ireena. He dragged her off in chains to the Burgomaster's mansion, and hasn't been seen since.We ingratiated ourselves with the cook, and were kind enough to help her carry some groceries into the house. We brought our wine bottle to Izek. We were shown to the library, where next session we will "interview" him.</p>

                    <p>***Note***Ned got random visitors literally 5 minutes before game time, and didn't immediately kick them out, so we went with a side quest for a bit before our inevitable combat.***We felt a pain, and a vision obscured our sight. Claws in the darkness, a glimpse of a dress, a moon and a clock. Time racing beneath us. A form tethered by a robe. Fear that time is running out.We were left with a sense that something is running in the background of our minds.Something had reached out to us and sent us this vision.Viktor, the Mayor's Son, reached out to us with his mind; it was incredibly urgent.Gregor kept Izek entertained while the three of us went up to Viktor's room.He claimed that the vision was from someone named Stella."A few months ago, I was practicing magic". He had been wandering the Ethereal plane and he met Stella Wachter. They experimented with undead rabbits, but the test did not go well. The circle failed to teleport, but her soul was trapped kept alive by someone named Erasmus.Viktor has realized that the mirror in his room can connect to the Ethereal Plane. He and Stella have been using it to communicate. Her wandering spirit can not speak through it but can use gestures and lip reading. He's been trying to restore her soul to her body. Her body is fading and being pulled into the ethereal plane. It seems that time is passing faster for her, and is quickly running out.Viktor knows a ritual to teleport up to 9 people into the Ethereal plane. It requires the heartstone of a night hag and must be performed at the full moon (4 days from now). The moon cycle in Barovia is faster than in our world.Stella and Erasmus have been hiding, and suspect that something is hunting her. They have regularly seen a gaunt female figure with sallow gray-blue skin, ram's horns, and yellow teeth - looks like a night hag!If so, she's been wandering around the refugee camp.Player Note: Night HagsWe're wandering the Refugee Camp, asking questions and trying to find the hag.We spoke with Emeric and Magda, who we knew from the Werewolf fight. We also know Margrit and Donovan.Magda reported that they hadn't been attacked since our battle a few nights earlier. They've also been fortifying their camp and it looked better defended than before.Franz in camp "truly has it worst off". He lost his wife and children. He's been having nightmares. We were advised to speak with Nianka, his sister.He was afraid of demons sent by "Mother Night" to collect his soul. Nianka thinks that this is caused by the pies. Franz left Barovia when his wife died 3 months ago, with his two children. He started buying "Dream Pastries", which brought him visions of his wife. Only 3 nights ago, Franz took his two children down to the treeline. They didn't come back. "Don't tell them! I am too ashamed!"He tells us the rest of the story. He met the pie peddler; she would give him as many pies as he could eat, every morning for the rest of his life, in return for his two children. She placed them in a magical sleep and stuffed them in a sack. His daughter Myrtle cried out, and he demanded his children back, but she laughed at him and put him to sleep.He describes the nightmares he suffers every night, in which a hideous hag kneels on his chest and mocks him while his children cry in the background.Another Sending from Viktor; he has a plan!It's possible to bind a hag to a circle, but they are fierce fighters and it will take silver weapons to defeat them.Viktor had a circle in an old spellbook which might be able to bind a hag.We saw a figure in the mirror:Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Stella has seen a much larger version of that same circle, surrounding Wachter House. It's preventing her from returning to her body and communicating with her mother.Lady Wächter has a theory as to what happened to her daughter. She had intended to gain power via marriage between Stella and Viktor. "Stella found Viktor to be demented, showing no interest in her". She believes that Viktor's unkind words destroyed her mind.Lady Fiona can put the circle down temporarily, but she's worried that reducing its protection can put them in danger. Her family died years ago before the barrier was created.She has a small scale model of the house itself. She offered a short prayer, and a circle of gray light appeared on the model, which then disappeared. Stella manifested and her mother was convinced that we knew what we were talking about.</p>

                    <p>We started out with a flashback to Gregor drinking with Izek while we started in on Stella's subplot.Gregor immediately poured out a round of the poisoned wine.He started off a little bit on the wrong foot, offending Izek and momentarily confising Ireena and Arabella. Both of them failed some saves, but Gregor tricked him into revealing some of his back story. He grew up with his sister in Vallakai. His sister was killed by wolves, he lost an arm, but "got strong". The Baron adopted him and he became an enforcer and captain of the guards.Izek revealed that he dreams of Ireena, as a warrior Valkyrie, and seems to think that she is his sister reborn.Izek told a story of revenge against wolves, wiping out a den of wolves with his guards. We countered with our fight vs the werewolves.We beat Izek. It was a very difficult fight. We managed to defeat him, and prevented him from setting his house on fire.</p>

                    <p>(Almost) everyone showed up on time tonight! I arrived at 3:05 to find everyone already present!. LOLWe brought Izek's head to Lady Wächter. She was prepared, and sent a dozen guards out to do whatever she had planned. Surely this won't come back to bite us.Lady Wächter suggested that it would be possible to bind the Night Hag(s)? with a magical circle similar to the one surrounding her house.We took our leave, returned to the partially repaired inn, trying to get some dinner and rest. Francis attempted some repairs to the inn's doors.It turns out that the amber shard we took from Izek is slightly magical, with a whiff of protection magic.Lady Wächter kept her word - refugees from Barovia were coming into the town, her green-cloaked watchmen were overlooking the town guard.After her introductory speech, we received our new weapons and armor.Lady Wächter read us an excerpt from her family history:--The Noble House of Wachter - by Lovina WachterThe wedding of Prince Sergei von Zarovich and Tatyana Federovna began with good cheer, but ended in madness and blood. Prince Sergei was found dead in his chambers, his bride-to-be rumored to have cast herself from the overlook in despair.Though no suspect was confirmed, Leo Dilisnya—my own kin—led a treacherous uprising against Lord von Zarovich, abetted by a score of castle guards. When I sought to mediate, they turned upon us, slaughtering Vladislav and his mother and confining us within the confines of the kitchens.It was only by some miracle that Lord von Zarovich emerged unscathed from their assault. Now possessed with an unearthly power, he smote the traitors and drove Leo himself from the castle.In his escape, I saw Leo's face contort with hatred and disgust. "Blood-traitor, I name you, Lovina," he swore, "for your allegiance to the beast who abandoned Reinhold to his fate." He renounced our bond, proclaimed I was no longer of House Dilisnya, and vowed that he would one day expunge the Wachter blight from the valley—once and forevermore.I know not what has become of him. He is gone from the Pillarstone now, and though more of the treacherous guards return in caskets to the castle each day, his face is not among them. But each night I hear his voice in my nightmares, I know he yet lives—and dread the occasion of his return.--We went to the windmill:Image: The WindmillApparently the rotting canvas on the windmill sails is planned!We arrived at the windmill around noon. We stealthily approached from the back, and Francis boosted me up to the balcony level.Scouting was ineffective, so we returned to town and picked up our spellcaster allies. We met a ragged druid on the way but arrived at the windmill unmolested.Viktor cast Greater Invisibility on me, and I snuck into the windmill!Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »We got the contract and learned the hag's true names!Morgantha Stormreaver. Belladonna Sunbane. Offalia WormwiggleWe also got a bag with some cash, gems, and a charm of Heroism!</p>

                    <p>After a month and a half, we're standing in front of a windmill.We went over the Hag's contract, written on humanoid skin. Yuck. It's written in some kind of magical text that we couldn't read.Lady Wächter started her circle, Viktor stood ready to counterspell any attempt to block it, and we ran right in!It was a rough fight, but we prevailed - until the hags poofed into a nightmare when they couldn't depart the plane!Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Shared Asset: « New Shared Asset »Man those look weird. The fight continues ...We barely defeated the shadow creatures. They offered us knowledge which would presumably have helped us later ... but we turned them down. Hard pass.Once they went down, the Windmill started crumbling. Artur and I rushed upstairs to rescue the kids. They were chained to the bed, but I picked the locks and we got them out - one ran down the stairs, Artur had to grab the other and escape out the window.</p>

                    <p>A new hand touches the beacon: the best log writer ever.We continue our quest to save Vaelen from lycanthropy. In the ruins of Berez, we shall find Baby Lasagna, and she will scry to find the Krezk Burgermaster's son.We come to a foggy swamp that is creepy as all heck. The town is more of a sunken ruin, really, with an eerie and unnatural fog. We find meet Winestia, probably a witch, and she takes us to Baba, who lives on a big hut, 15 feet off the ground on a big rotting stump. We climb up, and the hut is about what you would expect from a witch's hut. The random hanging skin flaps really pull the whole room together.Mother Lysaga asks us to pluck a feather and give it to her baby...which is just an illusion. We give her the bracelet, and hair, from Krezk. She asks us to bring a goat to her, so we go to the pen, say a secret phrase (“Death to Ravenovia”), and a gate appears. She sacrifices the goat in a bathtub, as one does, and performs the scrying. All perfectly normal.“I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is a woman chained beside him, sharp-eyed and with long, shaggy hair. I smell the gift of Mother Night on her. Nearby, I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses kneel before her, bent to her majesty.”We left the swamp, briefly considered investigating some standing stones, but thought better of it after seeing a phase spider lair. Artur successfully argues that we are short on time. Back to Krezk we travel, without incident, deliver the witch's portent, and become welcome guests in the Abbey. At the pool, we find some wolfsbane, and we make our way back to Vallaki.Back in Vallaki, we give the wolfsbane to Rictavio, and he gets to work brewing a potion for Vaelen. We have some tea and dinner at the Blue Water Inn, and return to Rictavio, who elaborates that this potion only suppresses the lycanthropy for the night of the full moon. The night, thankfully, passes uneventfully.We head to the vineyard to figure out why Davian Martikov is not shipping wine. Maria, a lively young lady joins us, and we head down the road to the south. On our way there, we perceive a pit trap in the road, and fight some vine monsters.</p>

                    <p>We start off by fighting Vine Blights...which was a little anti-climactic, but we will not complain.The blights appeared to look a lot like grape vines! Interesante. Perhaps this is why the wine is not flowing?We get to the vineyard, and it is very gloomy...it starts raining, we hear the caws of strix, and a hooded old dude near the edge of a nearby forest beckons us. We were not interested in free candy, but Muriel the wereraven urges us to follow him. We go underground to a refuge...and find the Martikovs.Davian the old man is a grumpy old codger, but relays that the druids have taken over the vineyard. There is an underground tunnel leading to the winery. Sounds like it's some staff that a druid is waving around is controlling the blights. A neighborly dispute, but the old man is not telling us everything. He and is brother Irwin are fighting like crazy.Baba Lysaga seems to be behind some of this.We take the secret tunnel, and we are warned of heat-sucking brown mold. We Ray of Frost our way through some mold, and loot some Winter Wolves teeth that are likely belonging to the winery owners. We get to the winery, which is quite warm especially compared to the moldy tunnel.As we go through the winery, we overcome three druid encounters, each accompanied by more vine blights.Artur's lightning bolt blasted the crap out of our last fight.</p>

Molock claims to have been traveling with the Martikovs, which is how they contracted lycanthropy.We proceed and find a tree leaking blood and a man with a staff...DUN DUN DUN! It is also leaking blood and smoke. There are strixes up in the tree. He seems quite mad, and talks about the wild folk. Something about Wintersplinter coming.At some point, your notetakeer failed you.We fought an insane amount of needle blights, but ended the plague.</p>

                    <p>The winery is the soul source of happiness for the people of Barovia. The wine is no longer flowing. This is related somehow to Baba Lysaga.The druids of Yester Hill are summoning Wintersplinter, which is some kind of monster.Gregor says we should have a diamond in case we die.Rachel catches Molock up a bit on the story so far, including the ghost girl stuck in the Ethereal Plane.We take a well-deserved rest, and Victor pings us letting us know he needs more heartstones to complete his ritual. The Martikovs let us know that their wines are grown using gemstones. Druids and Baba Lysaga have stolen all three of their gemstones. They need the gemstones to create wine-worthy grapes without sunshine. This is the first time the druids have been able to command the blights.They urge us to fight the druids to get back one of the gems. There is a stone circle at the top of Yester Hill. He suspects it will culminate tomorrow morning. With both Victor and the druid situation looming, we make the decision to have Muriel deliver the heartstones to Victor in her raven form, and Molock to scout Yester Hill in his raven form.Molock finds a good route of approach, but the hill is surrounded by stones. We make our way to Yester Hill, and fuckin Strahd appears. He is just swinging his vampire dick around on a flaming horse while most of us grin and bear it. Molock. on the other hand, is quite cordial...and perhaps even flirty. Disgusting. Strahd "gives us permission" effectively to disrupt the druid ritual.We go up the sneaky route...and assail the druids. Many druids. Strahd showed up carrying a chess pawn...whatever, bro. Let's just save the wine.The lead druid cast a wall of thorns around the chanting drum circle hippies, then a giant mist. Who knows what is happening. We left off mid-combat.</p>

Rachel kindly asks Erasmus if he wants to pass on words to Daddy von Richten, and he would like his father to know that all is forgiven, and that he will keep the Ethereal Plane safe.Erasmus says there are strange spiders going in and out of the plane to the south of Mallaki...we saw their lair. Strahd also visits the plane via his nightmare.We got a book from Victor...a magic tome with an arcane lock. We couldn't figure out the password, but it is word-activated. Lady Wachter also gave us the big ole mirror...we can shrink and expand it with a command. We can gaze into the ethereal plane within 60 ft using this, and also commune if we have the ability to do so...maybe with hand gestures like what Victor was doing with Stella. Rachel takes it with her.We rest during the evening, and head out in the middle of the night. Always a great idea in Barovia. We are assaulted by werewolves...but wipe them with limited wounds. We chase something in the woods, and end up with a butterfly statue. We end there before investigating it.</p>
